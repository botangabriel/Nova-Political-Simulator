# Welcome to Nova Political Simulator

What is this? This is an online political simulator built by me, Gabriel. This is my first project and I took heavy inspiration from the many online simulators and RP based games. This game is oriented around a fictional world formed of many nations in which players can run in nations as parties with various political ideologies in hope to win elections and implement own views on nations. Players as well can [make posts onto the official forum](https://nova-polsim.freeforums.net/) if they so wish. These posts can be anything from newspaper posts, to meetings and treaties, to civil wars or wars, all of course in concordance with the rules of Nova Political Simulator.

This project started with intetion to have fun and try my best to manage an online game of my own with own rules and nice community. Nova Political Simulator is in it's infancy and many things are to be fixed and improved over time. I plan to improve this to the level that in-game mechanics can cover parts of the RP, such as randomly generated elections, tax revenue and budget deficit, as well population and GDP.

The world players are playing in is called Nova, a world with fictional nations and cultures derived from the real life counterparts, with twists and various additions. This project was started on 28 august, 2020.
